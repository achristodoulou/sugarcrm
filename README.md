SugarCrm Refurbished
====================
This project aims to improve the functionality of legacy SugarCrm Community version 6.5 by applying the
latest best practices, using packages from other projects to minimize the maintenance of the whole project
and mostly to make the migration to PHP version 7 a reality.
